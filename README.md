# Standout
Standout is a text editor that allows you to format (Bold / Italic) your profile text with Unicode.

## How It Works
By converting text to Unicode, we can use Bold and Italic even if the site / app does not support it directly.

The editor is written in React / TypeScript and Fluent UI.

## How to Use
Type/copy profile text into the editor box, highlight text and click a button to apply the corresponding format. When finished, copy it to your profile.



## Limitations
The editor supports Bold for letters / numbers, and Italic for letters.

NOTE: Any text that is styled (Bold or Italic) is NOT searchable!
